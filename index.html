  I am a Ph.D. candidate in Applied Mathematics, working on dynamical systems (especially piecewise smooth maps), at the <b><i>School of Mathematical and Computational Sciences (SMCS) </i></b>, <a href="https://www.massey.ac.nz/">Massey University</a>, under the supervision of <a href=" https://www.massey.ac.nz/~djwsimps/">
  Dr. David Simpson </a> and co-supervision of the <a href="https://www.massey.ac.nz/massey/expertise/profile.cfm?stref=677230">Distinguished Professor Robert Mclachlan</a>.<br /> I am funded under <b>Marsden grant 18-MAU-017</b> titled "<a href="https://www.royalsociety.org.nz/what-we-do/funds-and-opportunities/marsden/awarded-grants/marsden-fund-awards-2018/">Organised chaos: Using geometry to explain robust chaotic dynamics in switched dynamical systems</a>". Last
  year, I worked as an organizer for the <b><a href="https://pycode-conference.org/">PyCode 2021 Conference</a></b>.
  
 Prior to joining as a Ph.D. student at Massey University, I had a small stint in an industry setting at <a href="https://www.sirpi.io/">Sirpi Products and Services Pvt. Ltd.</a> where I worked as 
  a research lead and the lead of spatial wind software project called <b><i>SHEAR</i></b> whose purpose was to extrapolate wind data based on given anemometer heights.
  Before that, I completed my Masters from the department of Physics, <a href="http://www.jaduniv.edu.in/" target="_blank">Jadavpur University</a>. My specialization was in Condensed Matter Physics. 
  My academic interests lie in Nonlinear dynamics, Computational Physics, Open Source scientific Software, Game Theory, Quantum Computing and Data Analysis.<br />
  
 I maintain a blog, <b><a href="https://realsoccerexpand.netlify.app/">Introductory Football (Soccer) Data Analysis</a></b> targeted towards those who want to learn football data analysis with Python. I also maintain an open source blog where I write about
  <a href="https://indrag49.github.io/Numerical-Optimization/">Mathematical Optimization using Python</a>. <br />
  
  I believe in the fact that science is an art form by itself and there exists no distinct boundary between these two gorgeous fields. My artistic curiosity is focused on poetry reading and writing (this is infrequent though!).

  Hobbies include being a die-hard fan of <b>Real Madrid</b> football team, binge-watching animes till my eyes give up (not recommended!), reading Bengali literature and listening to
  music by the likes of Metallica, Led Zepellin, Nirvana, etc. <br />
