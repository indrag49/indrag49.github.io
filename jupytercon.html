Last year I had the privilage to attend <a href="https://jupytercon.com/">JupyterCon 2020</a> that was held virtually, thanks to Covid-19. Given, the mental toll the pandemic enforced upon the global population,
it was actually a pleasure to attend the conference virtually and listen to the talks from the industry experts. All the talks are openly available to the public through the conference's
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_1BH3ug7n1KCiM-g0x9ZoWuDNhwuM1kr">YouTube channel</a>. I would still go back and listen to these talks that are relevant to my research and interests. For a moment, I even thought of submitting a lightning talk but then I backed off 
due to some problems that I faced with our wifi connection. Some of the talks that I find very interesting are:

<ol>
  <li>The keynote talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2aqdYrJh-I&list=PL_1BH3ug7n1KCiM-g0x9ZoWuDNhwuM1kr&index=1&t=20s"> Next-generation frameworks for Large-scale AI</a> by <a href="https://research.nvidia.com/person/anima-anandkumar">Dr. Anima Anandkumar</a>, who is a Bren professor at Caltech and also the director of machine learning research at NVIDIA. I would say, she is one of the best researchers of present time in machine learning, and I always find her research very inspiring.</li>
  <li>Next, the talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0DsD0xjSPM&list=PL_1BH3ug7n1KCiM-g0x9ZoWuDNhwuM1kr&index=4">Tackling Toxic Culture in Tech Racism and Its Legacy</a> by <a href="https://www.keywiki.org/Tema_Okun">Dr. Tema Okun</a> from Duke University, who has spent 30 years of her life working on racial justice and equity. I would recomment the talk to anyone who wants to learn more on diversity, racism, equity and community building. She is also the author of the award wining book <strong>The Emperor Has No Clothes: Teaching About Race and Racism to People Who Don't Want to Know</strong>, and this must be in everyone's reading list interested on the topic. It surely is in mine. </li>
  <li>Recently, I have been much fascinated to learn about social network analysis, more specifically biological networks. The talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tip_eLf5m1M&list=PL_1BH3ug7n1KCiM-g0x9ZoWuDNhwuM1kr&index=10">Automating biological network visualization with Jupyter Notebook</a> by <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kozo-Nishida">Kozo Nishida</a> from the Quantitative Biology Center (QBiC), RIKEN. This talk has inspired me to delve more into bilogical network visualization and data visualization in general. Just fantastic!</li>
  <li>I have used Fortran during my undergraduate and master studies in Physics and I would say, whatever text editors or compilers I used to run the code, did not help at all. It was too difficult to manage. But the talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MKZjeRozPI&list=PL_1BH3ug7n1KCiM-g0x9ZoWuDNhwuM1kr&index=19">LFortran</a> on the modern open-source Fortran compiler LFortran, which enable the interactive execution of code in Jupyter, by <a href="https://ondrejcertik.com/">Dr. Ondřej Čertík</a> et al. was eye opening to me. Dr. Čertík is also the original author of SymPy and SymEngine, besides LFortran. Presently, he is a scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory, USA</li>.

I have learned a lot from the conference, and I will surely try to visit the in-person conference once that is permitted.
