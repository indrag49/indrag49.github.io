I have been developing an <strong>R package</strong> that will help the community coming from a physics and/or an engineering background to carry out various calculuations and develop visualizations in computational physics
with the help of R language. Currently, the name of the package that i have decided to stick to is <strong>``compho"</strong>, as in <strong>computational photonics<\strong>.
I will add relevant documentations and eventually will open source the project once it has a presentable format. The package is under development and untill now, I have used the following dependencies: <strong>ggplot2</strong> and <strong>pracma</strong>.
But first thing first, I will add simple examples here to demonstrate workings of some functions.
  
  <ol>
    <li> <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sellmeier_equation"><strong>The Sellmeier Dispersion plot for BK7 glass</strong></a>
    <figure>
      <pre>
      <code>
      > #BK7 glass
      > Sellmeier_dispersion_plot(0.2, 2, 1.03961212, 0.231792344, 1.01046945, 6.00069867*10**-3, 2.00179144*10**-2, 103.560653)
      </code>
      </pre>
      </figure>
    This will generate the plot given below,
