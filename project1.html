I have been developing an <strong>R package</strong> that will help the community coming from a physics and/or an engineering background to carry out various calculuations and develop visualizations in computational physics
with the help of R language. Currently, the name of the package that i have decided to stick to is <strong>``compho"</strong>, as in <strong>computational photonics<\strong>.
I will add relevant documentations and eventually will open source the project once it has a presentable format. But first thing first, I will add simple examples here to demonstrate workings of some functions.
