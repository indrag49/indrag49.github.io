This blog could have been an email! However, I decided to take the longer road of explicitly breaking down each and every step I took to run simulations of a network of slow-fast neurons.
This blog is intended to teach the community how to accelerate simulations of neuron models on connected random networks. Okay, this blog is actually to teach <em>myself</em> how to accelerate simulations of neuron models on connected random networks.
This blog could have been a journal article!
