This blog could have been an email! However, I decided to take the longer road of explicitly breaking down each and every step I took to run simulations of a network of slow-fast neurons.
This blog is intended to teach the community how to accelerate simulations of neuron models on connected random networks. Okay, this blog is actually to teach <em>myself</em> how to accelerate simulations of neuron models on connected random networks.
This blog could have been a journal article!

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:model_single}
\begin{aligned}
    \dot{x} &= f(x, y, I) = x^2(1-x) - y + I, \\
    \dot{y} &= g(x, y, I) = A e^{\alpha x} - \gamma y, \\
    \dot{I} &= h(x, y, I) = \varepsilon\Bigg[\frac{1}{60}\Bigg\{1+\tanh\Bigg(\frac{0.05-x}{0.001}\Bigg)\Bigg\} - I\Bigg],
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

<p>Equation \(\ref{eq:model_single}\) defines the model dynamics.</p>
